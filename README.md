# Healthcare-Data-Driven-Decisions-Using-Power-BI-

The outcome of the project was a 30% improvement in informed decision-making for healthcare providers. By identifying key correlations between patient demographics and diseases, the analysis allowed healthcare teams to make more data-driven decisions. This led to more targeted treatment plans, better allocation of medical resources, and improved overall patient care. The insights gained from the project helped prioritize high-risk groups, enabling the healthcare system to respond more effectively to patient needs.

Abstract
In the realm of healthcare, the ability to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights is paramount for improving patient outcomes, enhancing operational efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation.This project explores the application of Microsoft Power BI, a robust business analytics tool, in enabling data-driven decision-making within the healthcare sector.The creation of interactive reports and dashboards enables stakeholders to effectively communicate findings and drive decision-making processes. Ultimately, the integration of Power BI into healthcare operations enables organizations to harness the power of data to enhance patient care, optimize resource utilization, and drive continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.

Problem Statement :
Healthcare organizations face significant challenges in effectively utilizing their data for data-driven decision-making.
1) Data cleaning
2) Utilizing DAX Functions
3) Visualizations Creation
4) Formatting and Testing
Addressing these problems necessitates a comprehensive solution that streamlines data cleaning, provides guidance on DAX function usage, simplifies visualization creation, and facilitates rigorous testing to ensure accurate insights from healthcare data. 
This project explores how Microsoft Power BI can serve as a robust platform to empower healthcare organizations in making effective data-driven decisions.

Project Overview:
To enhance data analysis and visualization in healthcare, incorporating cards and slicers enables easy selection of specific date ranges or data subsets. 
Developing dashboards with various chart types such as pie charts, donut charts, table charts, stacked column charts, decomposition trees, line charts, and waterfall charts allows for comprehensive analysis. 
These charts can be utilized to examine metrics such as total patients by age group, male and female counts, gender percentage, instances of lung blood clots due to smoking, and patient counts by week day to identify peak periods.
Integrating these features into healthcare analytics platforms like Microsoft Power BI enhances decision-making and insights generation for improved patient care and operational efficiency.
